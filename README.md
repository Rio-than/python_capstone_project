# **Python Capstone Project Proposal**  

## **Project Overview**  

### **Project Title**  
**Solar Power Output and Energy Demand Calculator**  

### **Project Summary**  
This project is a Python-based solar energy calculator using Tkinter. It allows users to select a region in Kenya from a specified number of regions;kisumu,bomet,nyandarua,mandera,mombasa, specify a solar panel size, and choose household appliances from a list of common appliances;television,sound system,iron box,lighting set as default, to estimate solar power generation and daily energy consumption. Based on the calculations, the program provides recommendations on whether the panel size is sufficient or if an upgrade is necessary.

## **Problem Statement**  

### **What problem will your Python project solve?**  
- Many people in Kenya struggle to estimate the correct solar panel size for their energy needs.  
- This tool helps users determine if their selected panel can generate enough power for daily use based on weather data for different regions.  

### **Why is this solution needed?**  
- Provides data-driven insights into solar panel efficiency across various regions.  
- Helps users make informed decisions before purchasing solar panels.
- Helps users who want to add more appliances from the listed appliances.
- Helps solar panel distributors to advice their clients on most suitable panel size.  
- Encourages the adoption of renewable energy by simplifying the estimation process.  

### **Who will use this program?**  
- Homeowners and institutions considering solar panel installations.  
- Solar energy consultants and technicians. 
- Small businesses looking to optimize solar energy usage.

## **Program Structure**  

### **Core Features**  

1. **Region-Based Solar Output Calculation**  
   - Users select a region in Kenya to retrieve solar irradiance and cloud cover data.  
   - The program uses this data to estimate the daily solar energy output for the selected region.  

2. **Solar Panel Size Input and Validation**  
   - Users can manually enter a panel size or select from predefined sizes (small, medium, or large).  
   - The program ensures the input is valid and provides feedback if corrections are needed.  

3. **Energy Demand Calculation Based on Appliances**  
   - Users select common household appliances they intend to power using solar energy.  
   - The program calculates the total daily energy consumption based on selected appliances.  

4. **Solar Output vs. Power Demand Comparison**  
   - The program compares the estimated solar energy output with the total power demand.  
   - If the panel is insufficient, a recommendation is given to consider a larger panel and details of panel supplier given

## **Program Design**  

### **Functions and Classes Overview**  
- The program is structured using **classes** to manage solar panel attributes and energy calculations.  
- **Functions** handle user input validation, energy demand calculations, and power output comparisons.  
- The **GUI components** interact with these functions to provide a smooth user experience.  

---

### **Data Storage**  
- The program does not require a database.  
- It uses a **hardcoded dictionary** to store solar irradiance and cloud cover values for different regions.  

---

### **Error Handling**  
- Ensures valid user input for panel size and region selection.  
- Displays appropriate error messages for invalid or missing data.  
- Prevents crashes due to incorrect input formats.  

---

## **Testing Strategy**  

- **Unit Testing:**  
  - Verify that solar panel output calculations return correct values.  
  - Test if invalid inputs trigger appropriate error messages.  
  - Ensure the program functions correctly with different appliance selections.  

- **User Testing:**  
  - Conduct tests with sample users to gather feedback on usability.  
  - Identify and fix any issues with the user interface.

## **Project Delivery**  

### **Running the Program**  
1. Install **Python 3.13**  
2. Run the program using the command:  
   ```
   python solar_panel.py
   ```

### **Sample Usage**  
**Example Scenario:**  
- **Region Selected:** Kisumu  
- **Panel Size:** 1.0 mÂ²  
- **Appliances:** Television, Iron Box  

**Expected Output:**  
- **Projected Daily Solar Output:** 2.42 kWh  
- **Total Daily Power Requirement:** 1.65 kWh  
- **Conclusion:** The solar panel can meet the daily power demand.
